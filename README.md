# Topsy-Turvy Game

## Why is it called Topsy-Turvy?
The game is just Connect4 if you rotated it 90 degrees and laid it down flat instead of having it stand upright (aka, no gravity involved). So it's basically "disoriented Connect4".

## What's the stack?
- Django (with Django Channels for WebSocket communication)
- Redis (for dealing with channel layer groups in Django Channels)
- React on the frontend

## How can I install and run it?
